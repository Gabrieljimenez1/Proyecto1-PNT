    <p class="Tituloseccion">METAVERSE, The new promising future?</p>
    <p class="informacion">An important topic to talk about is the metaverse but what exactly is the metaverse? The
      metaverse or meta universe
      (acronym for "meta-" 'beyond' and 'universe') is a concept that denotes the next generation of the internet, which
      describes an immersive and multisensory experience in the applied use of various devices and technological
      developments
      on the internet. The metaverse is generally composed of multiple three-dimensional, shared and persistent virtual
      spaces, linked to a perceived virtual universe, can not only refer to virtual worlds, but to the multidimensional
      experiences of use and application of the internet, Metaverses are environments where humans interact socially and
      economically as avatars, through a software in a cyberspace, the one that acts as a metaphor for the real world,
      but
      without the physical or economic limitations imposed there. This new way of interacting through the internet, and
      even
      relating to a new type of environment exposes many challenges that will first have to be overcome, one of them is
      the
      decrease in real interaction throughout this environment, starting with personal relationships that are not part
      of the
      metaverse, because, by spending excessive time in the metaverse, the real interaction with its environment is
      lost.
      Another challenge to overcome is privacy and security within this, to achieve a safe environment policy must be
      imposed
      that other users or the owners or administrators of the platform are not allowed to interact with the privacy of
      users,
      whether is personal messages, credit data, preferences and others.
      <br><br>
      On the other hand, there are also great benefits which can be the following:
      <br>
      -Social interaction: metaverses allow social interaction between users regardless of their physical location,
      bringing sensation closer to physical presence.
      <br>
      -High degree of personalization: the metaverse allows a high degree of customization such as: avatar of users
      spaces, objectives, clothes, etc.
      <br>
      -Events: Massive events can be held in metaverses without the risk of spreading diseases by the agglomeration of
      people or traveling to a specific place to attend the event.
      <br>
      So, do you think the metaverse will replace social media in the future?

    <p class="Tituloseccion">Dawn Fm, Newest from The Weekend</p>
    <p class="informacion">His fifth studio album released on January 7, 2022. Intended to serve as a direct follow-up
      to
      their fourth album After
      Hours, The Weeknd described the album's concept as a state of purgatoryâ€”a journey into "light at the end of a
      tunnel,"
      an upbeat record containing dance-pop and synth-pop songs that are heavily inspired by the new wave, funk, and EDM
      styles of the 1980s. The album received widespread praise from music critics, who praised its psychedelic concept,
      production, and melodies. Two singles that were released from the album, of which the lead single "Take My Breath"
      peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100. Dawn FM received widespread praise from music critics. 36 On
      Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received
      an
      average score of 88 based on 22 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim."

    <p class="Tituloseccion">Elden Ring, An instant classic</p>
    <p class="informacion">FromSoftware does it again and signs an instant classic, Elden ring is the definitive
      adventure, a work we always dream
      of, fortunately for humanity, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the father of jewels like Dark Souls, Bloodborne or Sekiro:
      Shadows Die
      Twice, has materialized that dream through a breathtaking journey through the Middle Lands, a gigantic world of
      dark
      medieval fantasy in which each step equals a new surprise. This time FromSoftware has collaborated with the famous
      writer George R.R. Martin, the author of the A Song of Ice and Fire series of books, who has helped create this
      universe
      and craft its backstory.
      <br>
      Its plot premise is apparently simple: look for some demigods to kill them and obtain the great runes they
      possess, some
      artifacts that will allow us to rebuild the Elden Circle and gain their power. This time the puzzle is not as
      difficult
      to put back together as in previous studio projects and, at least, everything related to the main mission is
      explained
      in a much clearer way. Of course, keep in mind that the narrative has several layers of depth and that in this way
      you
      will only stay on the surface. Not in vain, as soon as you scratch you will find an enormous number of mysteries
      and
      unknowns that will help you to have a better understanding of what really happens in this world.
      <br>
      It may be one of the best games of the year with a 95 out of 100 on metacritic. So, what are you waiting for to
      try this
      new and epic medieval adventure from FromSoftware.
