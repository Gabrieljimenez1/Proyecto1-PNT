    <p class="Tituloseccion">METAVERSE, The new promising future?</p>
    <p class="informacion">An important topic to talk about is the metaverse but what exactly is the metaverse? The
      metaverse or meta universe
      (acronym for "meta-" 'beyond' and 'universe') is a concept that denotes the next generation of the internet, which
      describes an immersive and multisensory experience in the applied use of various devices and technological
      developments
      on the internet. The metaverse is generally composed of multiple three-dimensional, shared and persistent virtual
      spaces, linked to a perceived virtual universe, can not only refer to virtual worlds, but to the multidimensional
      experiences of use and application of the internet, Metaverses are environments where humans interact socially and
      economically as avatars, through a software in a cyberspace, the one that acts as a metaphor for the real world,
      but
      without the physical or economic limitations imposed there. This new way of interacting through the internet, and
      even
      relating to a new type of environment exposes many challenges that will first have to be overcome, one of them is
      the
      decrease in real interaction throughout this environment, starting with personal relationships that are not part
      of the
      metaverse, because, by spending excessive time in the metaverse, the real interaction with its environment is
      lost.
      Another challenge to overcome is privacy and security within this, to achieve a safe environment policy must be
      imposed
      that other users or the owners or administrators of the platform are not allowed to interact with the privacy of
      users,
      whether is personal messages, credit data, preferences and others.
      <br><br>
      On the other hand, there are also great benefits which can be the following:
      <br>
      -Social interaction: metaverses allow social interaction between users regardless of their physical location,
      bringing sensation closer to physical presence.
      <br>
      -High degree of personalization: the metaverse allows a high degree of customization such as: avatar of users
      spaces, objectives, clothes, etc.
      <br>
      -Events: Massive events can be held in metaverses without the risk of spreading diseases by the agglomeration of
      people or traveling to a specific place to attend the event.
      <br>
      So, do you think the metaverse will replace social media in the future?
